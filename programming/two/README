Description: Building off of program zero, this program speeds up the process of counting the frequency of each alphabet letter in .txt files under a given directory by using multithreading.

Files included:
makefile
README
count.h - header file and type definitions
alphabetcountmulthreads.c - counts the frequency of alphabet letters using parallel multithreads
testmulthreads.c - alphabetcount test file

Known errors: N/A

Execution commands:
make testmulthreads - generates testmulthreads executable
./testmulthreads ## - runs the testmulthreads program to count frequency of alphabet letters with a given number of threads, result stored as file 'result.txt' under 'result' folder, ** number of threads wanted goes at ## in command

Test results:

% ./testmulthreads 3
